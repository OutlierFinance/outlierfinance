I am a twenty something telecommuting, Linux running, Dvorak typing, banjo pickin', unicycling, stick shifting seeker of financial independence by 35. I tend to be weird in everything else I do, so why not when it comes to finances too?

I love learning about finance but yearn for better math and statistics in the information available. My goal is to track my progress on my path to financial independence while providing the numbers behind the decisions made along the way.
