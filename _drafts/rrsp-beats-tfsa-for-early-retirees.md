In my last post I discussed the differences between RRSPs and TFSAs and where the strengths of each lie. Today I want to discuss how RRSPs are intended to be used and how that works in favour of early retirees.

A few weeks ago, [The Mad Fientist](http://www.madfientist.com/how-to-access-retirement-funds-early/) went over some similar math for traditional vs Roth 401ks. The USA retirement account system is a bit more complicated than ours, but if you just look at the contribution rules our RRSPs function similarly to a traditional 401k/IRA (contributions are tax deferred) and our TFSAs are like a Roth 401k/IRA (contributions are made after tax and grow tax free).

The Mad Fientist has done a great job of demonstrating a real world application of these funds, so I will be replicating the math for Canadian accounts using similar assumptions.

# Comparison

For our purposes, we are going to assume three different investment strategies for retirement savings. You can either put your full investment into an RRSP, a TFSA, or a non-registered account.

## Assumptions

For our comparisons, I will be using the same hypothetical saver from the Mad Fientist article: a 30-year-old who plans to retire at age 40. This account will go untouched from ages 40 to 45, after which $9,000 will be withdrawn every year from age 45 to 60.

Let's assume a tax bracket of 25% during the contribution years and 15% during the withdrawal years. Since TFSAs have much less contribution room each year than RRSPs, we will use $10,000 of pre-tax money per year for contributions assuming that there is enough contribution room in the TFSA for all of our years of saving.

As for investment growth, we'll assume 10% per year equally split between capital gains and dividends to illustrate the point.

## Case 1 - Non-registered account

This is our control group as this is what we would need to do if we did not have access to any registered accounts. With $10,000 of pre-tax income, our saver will have $7,500 after paying 25% tax. Each year any dividends earned in this account will be taxed. Since [dividend tax rates are complicated](http://taxtips.ca/dtc/enhanceddtc.htm), we'll assume a simplified rate of 10% tax on dividends, meaning our account will grow at a rate of 5% growth and 4.5% dividends reinvested.

At 45, any shares sold will incur capital gains tax. Since [calculating your adjusted cost base is complicated](http://www.taxtips.ca/glossary/adjustedcostbase.htm), we'll assume a tax rate of 5% on withdrawals. To get the full $9,000 of spending money, our early retiree will have to withdraw $9,474 each year.

## Case 2 - RRSP

In this situation, the full $10,000 can be invested each year. Growth every year is tax free. When withdrawals start at age 45, in order to be able to spend $9,000 each year our early retiree will need to withdraw $10,588.

## Case 3 - TFSA

With the TFSA, $7,500 will be available after taxes have been paid each year. Growth and withdrawals will be totally tax free. Each year's withdrawals will be exactly $9,000.
